- [Graph.cool](https://graph.cool) is nice, with UI schema builded and further export; the team proposes using [react-router-relay](https://github.com/relay-tools/react-router-relay) and stays behind [babel-plugin-react-relay](https://github.com/graphcool/babel-plugin-react-relay).
- [Scaphold.io](https://scaphold.io/) â€” research TBD.
